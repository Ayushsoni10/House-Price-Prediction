# House-Price-Prediction

The code begins by loading a dataset on house prices, performing data exploration, handling missing values, and addressing outliers. It then encodes categorical variables, splits the data into training and testing sets, and fits a linear regression model to predict house prices. After evaluating the model's performance, it drops a variable, GarageType, and repeats the modeling process. The results are compared, and the second model, without the GarageType variable, is found to have a slightly lower R-squared value.
